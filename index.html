            Howdy, I'm Jake Wilde, a geographer and map nerd. This is my website.

        <p>
            I like to make maps and write. I make a lot of mapsâ€”some helpful, others, not so much.

            In addition to my maps and writings, heres a collection of some other
            fun things I've been working on.

                <a href="/developments/">Development Project Tracker</a> - Okay this one is kind of a 
                map, but its a special map. Each point tracks a real-estate dvelopment 
                proposal in Santa Clara County. Click on a node for development 
                details.
