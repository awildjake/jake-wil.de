            Howdy, I'm Jake Wilde, a geographer and map nerd. This is my website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to make maps and write about all sorts of geography adjacent 
            topics. I make a lot of mapsâ€”some helpful, others, not so much. Either 
            way, I need a place to share them, and this is that place. You can find 
            my creations by clicking the "<a href="/maps">maps</a>" button on the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't like my maps don't worry, I also share links to cool maps by other folks.

        <p>
            In addition to my maps and writings, heres a collection of some other
            fun things I've been working on.

            <li>
                <a>Development Project Tracker</a> - Okay this one is kind of a 
                map, but its a special map. Each point tracks a real-estate dvelopment 
                proposal in Santa Clara County. Click on a node for development 
                details.
