            Howdy, I'm Jake Wilde, a geographer and map nerd. This is my website.

            I like to make maps and write about all sorts of geography adjacent 
            topics.
            As a geographer, urban planner, and GIS nerd, I make a lot of mapsâ€”some 
            helpful, others, not so much. Either way, I need a place to share them, 
            and this is that place. You can find my creations by clicking the <a href="/maps2.html">MAPS</a> button on the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't like my maps don't worry, I also share links to cool maps by other folks.
