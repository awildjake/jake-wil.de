            Howdy, I'm Jake Wilde, a geographer and map nerd. This is my website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to make maps and write. I make a lot of maps—some helpful, others, not so much.

                proposal in Santa Clara County. Click on a node for development 
                details.
