Site designs also include a new public park and paseo.

Building 1 is a 12-story, 120-foot mixed-use building with 398 units and 12,139 sq. ft. of commercial space. Building 2 is a 10-story, 103-foot, mixed use-building with 374 units and 12,447 sq. ft. of commercial space. Building 3 is a single-story, 58,370 square foot commercial building reserved for a Whole Foods grocery store. Building 4 is a 7-story, 263-bed residential senior care facility.
