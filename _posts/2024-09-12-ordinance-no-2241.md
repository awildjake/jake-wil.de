Nearly a hundred years ago, San José's leaders made one of the single most important decisions in the city's history. On July 8th, 1929, the city council unanimously adopted Ordinance No. 2241, the city's first zoning ordinance.[^1]

Land use regulation, and espescially zoning, is a powerful tool. While maybe not immediately apparent how, few laws permit San Jose's government greater control over the lives of its residents than zoning.

As planner Sonia Hirt explains, zoning, by regulating what gets built where, "sets the basic spatial parameters of where and thus how we live, work, play, socialize, and exercise our rights to citizenship." It touches nearly every facet of our lives, even influenincing "where we can and should meet each other, the streets we can and should travel on, how many cars we can and should have, and the kinds of homes we can and should live in. It tells us about the activities we can and should perform at home and the kinds of people we can and should live near."

Zoning imposes what Hirt describes as a "moral geography" upon our cities. A zoning ordinace—rather than presenting a perfect matmatical model for deriving the best use of land—represents a series of moral judgements regarding how one ought to live. In San Jose's case, these moral judgements were made around a century ago.

Despite being amended ad nesuem, San Jose's zoning ordinance still reinforces the moral assumptions of its original authors.

These assumptions are the root of many yet unresolved problems faced by San Jose, from the high cost of housing, to traffic and segregation; all of these problems can be traced to zoning. Tracing the lineage of these problems back to zoning is possible because these problems are not some unforseen consequence but are instead the intended product. To resolves these issues, there's only one option: the City of San Jose must do away with the practice of zoning.

To understand why this is the only option, it is necessary for San Jose to reflect on the moral foundations of zoning and what the authors of Ordinance No. 2241 hoped to accomplish with it.

Ordinance 2241 was the product of eight months of labor and a $5,000 cheque cut to [Harland Bartholomew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harland_Bartholomew), roughly equivalent in purchasing power to $92,000 in 2024 dollars. In comparison to what today's cities pay consultants, it was a dirt-cheap zoning ordinance. But in 1929, a Bartholomew and Associates zoning ordinance was as good as it got.

Harland Bartholomew was—and maybe still is—the most important urban planner in U.S. history.

He was the first planner. Or at least he was the first ever full-time urban planner on the payroll of an American city. He was appointed chair of numerous Federal planning committees by presidents Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Eisenhower. He developed the principles for locating urban highways. He taught civic design at the University of Illinois and civil engineering at Rutgers. His firm is responsible for producing more than 500 general plans for cities all across the country.[^2]

As busy as Bartholomew was, he had a particular interest in San José.

Before working on the city's zoning ordinance, his first job in San José was creating the city's major street plan. Later, in 1931, he would return to San José, this time to design a never-built civic center for Saint James Park.

But Bartholomew's work on Ordinance No. 2241 represents what he was most well known for in San Jose and elsewhere—zoning.

His most famous works of zoning were the ordinances he prepared for the city of Saint Louis, where he worked from 1918 to 1954. He prepared the first Saint Louis ordinance in 1920, and it was responsible for boosting his reputation across the country.

Bartholomew became famous nationwide for developing “rational, scientific methods for city planning” grounded in his era’s popular understanding of rationality.[^3] His zoning maps were calculating, meticulously crafted documents created by inventorying every structure and, most importantly, recording who lived there.

Knowing what kinds of people lived where was fundamental to Bartholomew's conception of zoning because zoning was, first and foremost, a tool of rationality, and at the time, the clear and most scientific thing to do to better the health of your city was to separate the black population from the white population.

Zoning would become the ultimate tool for enforcing racial segregation, and Bartholomew knew it.
