Nearly a hundred years ago, the leaders of San José, California, made one of the single most important decisions in the city's history. On July 8th, 1929, members of the city council unanimously adopted Ordinance No. 2241, the city's first zoning ordinance.[^1]

No other law is more responsible for ordering and shaping the lives of San Jose’s residents today than this ordinance. By regulating what you can build and where you can build it, zoning regulates everyday activity: where you can work, shop, learn, play, live, and, in doing so, sets the basic social organization of our lives. Any attempt to order space is also an attempt to tell us how we ought to live.

So, then, how is it the authors of Ordinance No. 2241 thought we should live? What vision did they have for San Jose and its residents? Did they achieve it? Who was and who wasn’t included in this vision?

If you live in San Jose, a short and maybe somewhat satisfactory answer can be found by just looking at your surroundings; you are living the vision.

A more complete understanding requires looking into the history of Ordinance No. 2241 and its author.

Ordinance 2241 was the product of eight months of labor and a $5,000 cheque cut to [Harland Bartholomew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harland_Bartholomew), roughly equivalent in purchasing power to $92,000 in 2024 dollars. In comparison to what today's cities pay consultants, it was a dirt-cheap zoning ordinance. But back in 1929, a Bartholomew and Associates-drafted zoning ordinance was as good as it got.

Harland Bartholomew was—and maybe still is—the most important urban planner in U.S. history. He was the first planner. Or at least he was the first ever full-time urban planner on the payroll of an American city. He was appointed chair of numerous Federal planning committees by presidents Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Eisenhower. He developed the principles for locating urban highways. He taught civic design at the University of Illinois and civil engineering at Rutgers. His firm is responsible for producing more than 500 general plans for cities all across the country.[^2]

As busy as Bartholomew was, he had a particular interest in San José.

Before working on the city's zoning ordinance, his first job in San José was creating the city's major street plan. Later, in 1931, he would return to San José, this time to design a never-built civic center for Sait James Park.

But Bartholomew's work on Ordinance No. 2241 represents what he was most well known for in San Jose and elsewhere—zoning.

His most famous works of zoning were the ordinances he prepared for the city of Saint Louis, where he worked from 1918 to 1954. He prepared the first Saint Louis ordinance in 1920, and it was responsible for boosting his reputation across the country.

Bartholomew became famous nationwide for developing “rational, scientific methods for city planning” grounded in his era’s popular understanding of rationality.[^3] His zoning maps were calculating, meticulously crafted documents created by inventorying every structure and, most importantly, recording who lived there.

Knowing what kinds of people lived where was fundamental to Bartholomew's conception of zoning because zoning was, first and foremost, a tool of rationality, and at the time, the clear and most scientific thing to do to better the health of your city was to separate the black population from the white population.

Zoning would become the ultimate tool for enforcing racial segregation, and Bartholomew knew it.
