Nearly a hundred years ago, San José's leaders made one of the single most important decisions in the city's history. On July 8th, 1929, the city council unanimously adopted Ordinance No. 2241, the city's zoning ordinance.[^1]

If you own property in San José, you are likely acquainted with its zoning ordinance and what zoning is. Zoning is what prevents you—in most cases—from converting your pre-school adjacent residence into an asbestos refinery. Or, for a more relatable example, dictates the height of your fence.

Generally, zoning is a tool employed by municipal government to control the uses and types of structures permissible on any given property within their jurisdiction. In a basic sense, zoning allows cities to restrict certain land for residential, commercial, and industrial uses.

Land use regulation, and especially zoning, is a powerful tool. While maybe not immediately apparent how, few laws permit San Jose as substantial control over residents' daily lives.

As planner Sonia Hirt explains, zoning, by regulating what gets built where, "sets the basic spatial parameters of where and thus how we live, work, play, socialize, and exercise our rights to citizenship." It touches nearly every facet of our lives, even influencing "where we can and should meet each other, the streets we can and should travel on, how many cars we can and should have, and the kinds of homes we can and should live in. It tells us about the activities we can and should perform at home and the kinds of people we can and should live near."

Zoning imposes what Hirt describes as a "moral geography" upon our cities. A zoning ordinance—rather than presenting a perfect mathematical model for deriving the best use of land in a scientific fashion as some would like to have you believe—represents a series of moral judgments regarding how one ought to live. In San Jose's case, its city council decided what constitutes a good life with the passage of Ordinance No. 2241 about a century ago.

Despite the passage of time and amendments ad nauseam, San Jose's zoning ordinance still inescapably reinforces the same moral assumptions of its authors. The issue with this is the men of a hundred years ago held very different ideas regarding how we should live and the arrangement of our human habitat than we hold today. Even worse, these assumptions are the root of many unresolved problems faced by San Jose, from the high cost of housing to traffic and segregation; all of these problems can be traced back to zoning. If the City of San Jose is to address any of these issues, it must do away with the practice of zoning as we know it.

To understand why this is the only option, San Jose needs to reflect on the moral foundations of zoning and what the authors of Ordinance No. 2241 hoped to accomplish.

Ordinance No. 2241 was the product of eight months of labor and a $5,000 cheque cut to Harland Bartholomew, roughly equivalent in purchasing power to $92,000 in 2024 dollars. In comparison to what today's cities pay consultants, it was a dirt-cheap zoning ordinance. But in 1929, a Bartholomew and Associates zoning ordinance was as good as it got.

Harland Bartholomew was—and maybe still is—the most important urban planner in U.S. history.

He was the first planner. Or at least he was the first ever full-time urban planner on the payroll of an American city. He chaired numerous Federal planning committees under presidents Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Eisenhower. He developed the principles for locating urban highways. He taught civic design at the University of Illinois and civil engineering at Rutgers. His firm is responsible for producing more than 500 general plans for cities all across the country.[^2]

As active as Bartholomew was, he had a particular interest in San José. He praised the city for its lack of faults and lauded C. B. Goodwin, the city manager from 1920 to 1944, saying he had “worked with no city manager whom I regard higher than Goodwin.”

Before working on the city's zoning ordinance, his first job in San José was the city's major street plan. Later, in 1931, he returned to San José to design a never-built civic center for Saint James Park.

But Bartholomew's work on Ordinance No. 2241 represents what he was most well known for in San José and elsewhere—zoning and segregation.

Between 1918 and 1954, Bartholomew worked as a planner for the city of Saint Louis, Missouri. While there, he developed the city’s 1920 zoning ordinance. Through this ordinance, Bartholomew sought a new method to maintain racial segregation.

The old method, known as racial zoning and the precursor to today’s zoning, fell out of favor in 1917 when the United States Supreme Court ruled a Louisville, Kentucky zoning ordinance unconstitutional in Buchanan v. Warley. 

Louisville’s zoning ordinance explicitly prohibited blacks from living in specific areas designated as “white.” This practice was not unique to Louisville, nor was it the first to implement such a law. Baltimore adopted the first racial zoning ordinance targeting blacks in 1910, and the practice was quite popular with many northern cities. Two decades earlier and not too far from San Jose, the city and county of San Francisco developed possibly the very first racial zoning ordinance. Known as the Bingham Ordinance, it designated “the location and the district in which Chinese shall reside and carry on business.”

When all these laws collapsed in a post-Buchanan v. Warley world, segregationist whites were sent scrambling in search of a new tool to enforce segregation, and it was Harland Bartholomew who presented such a tool to the nation.

Bartholomew was not the first to do so, but he was instrumental in popularizing zoning. Like others, he understood that that zoning could not explicitly mention race. In place of race, Bartholomew designated predominately white neighborhoods made up of single-family houses protected by racially restrictive covenants as “first residential” districts. In doing so, Bartholomew’s explicit goal was to prevent movement into “finer residential districts… by colored people,” noting that “where values have depreciated, homes are either vacant or occupied by colored people or boarding houses.’’ By reserving certain neighborhoods exclusively for large-lot, expensive single-family homes, cities could prevent disadvantaged lower-income blacks from buying into those areas. All other housing types, those more affordable to black families, were designated “second residential” and typically allowed polluting industrial and commercial uses as well.

A major part of Bartholomew’s work on zoning involved translating preexisting racially restrictive covenants into land use law. Restrictive covenants are a list of clauses recorded to a property that limit how its owner may use the land. A restrictive covenant can be as benign as limiting architecture, building height, or fence color. However, covenants can also contain more malicious obligations, such as restrictions barring property transfer to or occupation by non-white individuals. This second type of covenant is commonly called a racially restrictive covenant. The following is an example of a racially restrictive covenant clause from a property in  Santa Clara County:

> No persons not of the Caucasian Race shall be allowed to occupy, except as servants of residents, said real property or any part of thereof.

The presence of this kind of language made Bartholowmew’s job easier to carry out. However, until recently, there was little information regarding how common racially restrictive language actually was in San Jose at the time when Bartholomew was preparing the city’s ordinance.

Thanks to a paper published by researchers from Stanford in collaboration with Santa Clara County in 2024, we now know that covenants were likely exceedingly common in San Jose.

Racial covenants were usually recorded by home builders and were required by the Federal Housing Administration to receive an insured bank loan. As a result, roughly a third of covenants were recorded by just 10 housing developers. Between 1925 and 1929, builders recorded over 2,000 racial covenants, and by 1950, approximately one in four properties were racially restricted by covenant.

The same paper also found that the City of San Jose recorded racial covenants on public property. This complicates our historical understanding of covenants, as they were only upheld as constitutional as private contracts between individuals, not the government.
Unfortunately, the paper does not cite an exact number for San Jose, but the density of covenants was quite high during Bartholomew’s work. He would have had little issue matching up protected districts with an exclusive single-family designation.

Planners like Bartholomew sold exclusionary single-family zoning to cities as a way to solidify existing protections under the guise of public policy, and San Jose bought it.

Today, San Jose dedicates roughly 90% of its residential land to single-family use, the most of any major American city. It should start to make sense why San Jose continually ranks as the most expensive city in America.

The high cost of housing is the goal.

San Jose adopted its current zoning ordinance with the explicit intent of keeping prices high and the disadvantaged out. Nothing will change until San Jose repeals its zoning ordinance.

The city must be allowed to express itself freely. San Jose must allow diverse forms of housing and a mix of uses on all residential land.
