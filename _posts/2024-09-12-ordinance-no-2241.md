On July 8th 1929, the City of San José, California, adopted Ordinance No. 2241—it's very first zoning ordinance.[^1]

Ordinance 2241 was the product of eight months of labor and a $5,000 cheque cut to [Harland Bartholomew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harland_Bartholomew), roughly equivelant in purchasing power to $92,000 in 2024 dollars. A dirt cheap zoning ordinance by today's standards. But back in 1929, a Bartholomew and Associates produced zoning ordinance was as good as it got.

Harland Bartholomew was—and maybe still is—the most important urban planner in U.S. history. He was the the first ever full-time urban planner on the payroll of an American city; He chaired numerous Federal planning committees; He developed the principles for locating urban highways; He taught civic design at the University of Illinois; and his firm is responsible for producing dozens upon dozens of plans for cities all across the country.

As busy as he was, Bartholomew had a particular interest in San José. Before working on the zoning ordinance, his first job in San José was the creation of the city's major street plan. 

Later, in 1931, he returned to San José, this time to design a new civic center. 

Having been inspired by Daniel Burnham's 1905 plan for San Francisco, the City commissioned Bartholomew to design a similarly City Beuatiful civic center in St. James Park. The civic center was to become the home of new city and county administration buildings, museums, a post office, and a civic auditorium.

Unfortunately, the city was unable to get the county and post office to agree and could not raise the necessary funds on its own. As a result, Bartholomew's plans were never realized.
