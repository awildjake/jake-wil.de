>We shall be pointed to the fact that without State interference nothing effectual can be performed upon any large scale. And it is a fact.

The people were overcrowded because they were poor, and because they were poor they could not afford the obvious remedy: to move out where house room was cheaper: 

>Mearns, 1883, 15. 
>These wretched people must live somewhere. They cannot afford to go out by train or tram into the suburbs; and how, with their poor emaciated, starved bodies, can they be expected – in addition to working twelve hours or more, for a shilling, or less – to walk three or four miles each way to take and fetch? 

Who cares about housing affordability, the secret is transportation affordability. 

Charles Booth perfeormed a social survey of London and Classified its people into 4 strata:
- Class A:
- Class B:
- Class C:
- Class D:

>while in London in 1891 the average number of inhabitants to a building was 7.6, in Berlin it was 52.6

>Abercrombie, 1914, 219.
>Berlin is the most compact city in Europe; as she grows she does not straggle out with small roads and peddling suburban houses, but slowly pushes her wide town streets and colossal tenement blocks over the open country, turning it at one stroke into full-blown city.

>the zoning movement, which profoundly influenced the subsequent course of American suburban development, was, if anything, socially exclusionary in its purpose and its impact. Regional plans, like the celebrated New York Regional Plan of 1931, were largely concerned with better housing for those that could afford to pay.
