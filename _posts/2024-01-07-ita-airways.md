A direct flight from Rome to San Francisco takes roughly 12 hours. About enough time to watch six movies, or at least that's how many I fit in.

I actually hadn't intended to watch any moveis on the flight home, but a brain fog stemming from a cold I had woken up with on the day-of was beginning to settle in and prevented me from finishing Mary Beard's *SPQR* as I would have liked.

Since I had not prepared for the eventuality of my brain failing me, I hadn't put any movies on my laptop. I was left in the hands of my ITA Airways inflight entertainment system.

The selection was less than ideal. I considered watching Succession Season three for the third time thought it would be better to use this time to catch up on some of the movies I missed in 2024.

In hindsight, I should have just watched Succession again. Instead I got to spend time with *[Trap](https://letterboxd.com/film/trap-2024/)*, *[The Watchers](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-watchers-2024/)*, *[Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire](https://letterboxd.com/film/godzilla-kong-the-new-empire/)*, and *[Silent Night](https://letterboxd.com/film/silent-night-2023-1/)*. That was enough 2024 for me.

For the last few hours of air time I watched *[No Time to Die](https://letterboxd.com/film/no-time-to-die-2021/)* and *[Casino Royale](https://letterboxd.com/film/casino-royale-2006/)*. I am now a certified Bond head. Daniel Craig is fantasitc.

Barbra Broccoli, please free Bond from the clutches of Amazon and bring him back. I need more.
