In 1898, Ebenezer Howard published _To-Morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform_,
a book that he would later reprint in 1902 under the much more recognizable name of _Garden Cities of To-Morrow_.

This brief excerpt from Ebenezer Howard's Garden Cities of To-Morrow provides a backdrop for city planning examples such as Greendale and Levittown. Hopefully, the opening quotation: "I will not cease from mental strife/Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand/Til we have built Jerusalem/In England's green and pleasant land" reminds you of our previous discussions of the City Upon a Hill. We read Howard because so many of our forthcoming discussions of ideal public life are informed by his optimistic, indeed infectious, narrative. I will leave the description of his Garden City to the author, focusing instead on three key points.

1. A point
2. A second much better point
3. A third worse point actually

The purpose of Howard's plan is to sustain "a healthy, natural, and economic combination of town and country life" through a balance of work and leisure (p. 51). In this goal, Howard reflects the ideal in American public life to establish a harmonious relationship between the machine and garden. Technology, hardly a foe to civilization in Howard's view, is essential to healthy public life: "The smoke fiend is kept well within bounds in Garden City; for all machinery is driven by electric energy" (p. 55). Industry and agriculture coexist in his ideal community - as do city and countryside, utopia and arcadia. Howard's sense of balance - in this case, the concentric circles of the Garden City intersected by broad boulevards - assumes that ideal forms will shape and perfect human functions: "No really sound plan of action is in more need of artificial support than is any sound system of thought" (p. 57).
