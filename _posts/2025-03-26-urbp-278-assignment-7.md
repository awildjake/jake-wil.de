According to the most recent 5-year American Community Survey estimates from 2023, the City of Los Angeles has a total population of roughly 3,857,897 people.[^1]

The [Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan](https://apps.engineering.lacity.gov/lariverrmp/CommunityOutreach/pdf/LARRMP_Final_05_03_07.pdf) outlines a process for transforming the LA River into a series of parks.

Chapter 2 of the Plan outlines the vision for the LA River and lists several other cities from across the country as examples of river revitalization. The City of San Jose is among those listed. It would be interesting to compare the revitalization processes of the two cities.

Chapter 3 provides details regarding the existing conditions (as of 2007) of the LA River channel and divides the River into eight distinct "reaches." These reaches could serve as useful geographic units for future analysis.
